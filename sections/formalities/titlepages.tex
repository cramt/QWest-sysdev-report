}{% the abstract
The following report describes a system development process used with the agile development methods know as Scrum and Extreme Programming (XP). The aim of the developed system was to create a user-friendly system regarding filling out the world map based on the users' travels, for both solo and group travel. In order to create the best possible version of an application like this one, the development process should be one that corresponds best to the group size, time frame, and etc. With this in mind, the group analyzed 3 different development methods; The agile method, the waterfall method, and the unified process method. And with this, it was concluded that an agile approach was the method to which an application like Qwest would be the accurate approach. However, there're multiple agile methods, so again the group did an analysis of Scrum, XP, and Kanban and found a combination of Scrum and XP to bring the best possible potential to the application. With the process method issue solved, all that is left is the process itself, which is described through the second part of the report. The process is clearly outlined using the Scrum terminologies and XP practices, with a focus on risk management and quality assurance. The program architecture was selected to be a part of the report as well since in agile development the design of the program must be one of the first considerations, and to prove that Qwest is a program of a safe and high quality.
